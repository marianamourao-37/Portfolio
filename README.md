# Portfolio

Recently, I've developed a great interest in Data Science, mostly ambitioning to integrate projects directed to Health, having myself a Bachelor's degree in 
Biomedical Engineering. 

In order to gain experience with Data Science Tools and Methodologies, I'm expousing myself to online courses and guided projects. Initially, I attended an introduction course to Computer Science - [Harvard University's 2020 CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) -, in order to revive and reinforce fundamental concepts of programming. Then, I opted for the famous specialization course in Deep Learning -  [Deep Learning Specialization offered by ia.deeplearning on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) -, having reinforced some bases of neural networks previously taught in my bachelor course, as well as broaden the knowledge about them, with emphasis on the gradient descent algorithm and its variants, model optimization methodologies and structuring of machine learning projects. 

These were very informative courses, but there was a lack of a more practical component that would stimulate active participation in the projects, being excessively guided, conditioning critical and creative thinking. In the phase in which I am, I privilege learning through guided projects that value full participation in each stage of the project, giving an opportunity to explore critical and creative thinking. In this sense, the [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) platform was a major driver in the beginning of this journey. In this platform, I have completed a project named [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb). 

As more projects are developed, they'll be added to this repository.

# Projects

1. [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb)

In this project, an **introductory data analysis** is made towards a better understanding of **Android** and **iOS mobile apps** on the **Google Play** and the **App 
Store markets**, respectively, aiming to identify **tendencies** and **correlations** between app's attributes and their **profitability**. By doing that, the extracted 
knowledge may be useful to consolidate a strategic approach, taken by a company, for **developing an app** with certain attributes, that lead to an higher expected 
profitability on the two considered markets.

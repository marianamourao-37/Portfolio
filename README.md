# Portfolio

Recently, I have developed a strong interest in data science, particularly in its application to health-related projects. With my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, I am excited to combine my domain knowledge with the latest data science tools and methodologies.

To gain practical experience in data science, I have been taking online courses and participating in guided projects. I started with the [2020 CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) offered by Harvard University, which helped me reinforce my programming fundamentals. Next, I completed the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. This course expanded my knowledge of neural networks, with a focus on gradient descent algorithms, model optimization, and machine learning project structuring.

While these courses were informative, I wanted a more hands-on experience to develop my critical and creative thinking skills. That's why I turned to the [DataQuest platform](https://www.dataquest.io/), which offered guided projects that allowed for more active participation. I completed a project called [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb) and I plan to add more projects to my portfolio as I continue my data science journey.

Overall, I am passionate about using data science to drive real-world solutions in the field of biomedical engineering. Please take a look at my portfolio repository for examples of my work.

# Projects

1. [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb)

In this project, an **introductory data analysis** is made towards a better understanding of **Android** and **iOS mobile apps** on the **Google Play** and the **App 
Store markets**, respectively, aiming to identify **tendencies** and **correlations** between app's attributes and their **profitability**. By doing that, the extracted 
knowledge may be useful to consolidate a strategic approach, taken by a company, for **developing an app** with certain attributes, that lead to an higher expected 
profitability on the two considered markets.
